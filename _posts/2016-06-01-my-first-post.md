You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build
the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but
the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and
auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the
convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter.
Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
